Discover - a static analyzer for smart contracts
==============================================================================

Overview
--------

Discover is a static analysis tool that aims to find bugs and vulnerabilities in
computer programs and smart contracts. Currently, it can analyze programs
written in C, C++, and Solidity by compiling to and analyze the output LLVM
bitcode. We are also working to extend Discover to analyze smart contracts
written in Golang, Typescript of Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.
